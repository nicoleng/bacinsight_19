    "2. `Pandas` is a **Python Data Analysis** [Library](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and is a very loose acronym for **P**ython **An**alysis of **Da**taset**s** (or something like that) that provides open source, easy-to-use data structures and analysis tools which we will be using heavily throughout the rest of the semester. \n",
