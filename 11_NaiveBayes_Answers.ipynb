    "1. Accounts for the length of the document\n",
    "2. Words appearing frequently in a document but not in other documents in the population, is likely to be more important\n",
    "3. Inverse: the more time a word appears, the less significant it is for a specific document\n"

    "## Modeling with Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have been exposed to tree classifiers and logistic regression and SVM. Now, it's time for another popular modeling technique of supervised learning(especially in text classification): the Naive Bayes (NB) classifier. There are 3 types of NB classifiers:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Bernoulli Naive Bayes:**\n",
    "Predictors are boolean variables. The parameters used to predict class variable only takes (1/0), whether a word occurs in a text or not for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Multinomial Naive Bayes:**\n",
    "Mostly used for document classification problem, i.e whether a document belongs to the category of sports, politics, technology etc. The features/predictors used by the classifier are the frequency of the words present in the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Gaussian Naive Bayes:**\n",

    "Again, Naive Bayes model is a **probabilistic approach which assumes conditional independence between features** (in this case, each word is a feature, the conditioning is on the true class). It assigns class labels (e.g. spam = 1 or spam = 0). In other words, Naive Bayes models the probabilities of the presence of each _word_, given that we have a spam email, and given that we have a non-spam email.  Then it combines them using Bayes Theorem (again, as described in the book).\n",

    "### Takeaways\n",
    "Naive Bayes algorithms focuses on the idea that we assume some prior knowledge of our sample poulation and uses probablistic methods to infer class probability. A Naive Bayes classifier assumes that the presence (or absence) of a particular feature of a class is unrelated to the presence (or absence) of any other feature, given the class variable. Basically, it's \"naive\" because it makes assumptions that may or may not turn out to be correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages**\n",
    "- Very simple and efficient in terms of storage space and computational time. Training consists of storing counts of classes and occurences of features\n",
    "- Incremental learner: the model can be updated easily as new training data comes in without a need to retrain or reprocess all prior data \n",
    "- Useful for sentiment analysis, spam filtering, recommendation systems etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages**\n",
    "- The predictors must be independent for the class probability estimates to be accurate. If two predictors are correlated, you are basically double counting the effect that they have on each other as extra evidence for a particular class\n"
